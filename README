Assuming you have maven installed, and are using a unix/mac OS machine, run this command to execute the test:
mvn test -Dtest=curbsideJobs

NOTE: As of right now, the test purposefully fails, because I test for the State/Country to be labeled the same. 
Currently on shopcurbside.com/jobs, Quebec City has QC as the country, and on smartrecruiters it is Canada. 
I verify this in the test, hence the failure.
